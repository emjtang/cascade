/**
 * Patterns adapted from https://coderwall.com/p/o--apg
 *
 * Known caveats:
 *  - If Jackson is instructed to deserialize a non-conforming numeric from a String, it will fail, e.g attempting
 *    to deser an Int from "hello". Conversely, if Jackson is instructed to deser a String from a numeric, it will
 *    succeed, e.g. "100" from 100. If an object has an obvious String representation, Jackson will attempt to treat
 *    it as such.
 *
 *  - Null values will be treated as valid JSON. This is because `null` is a valid JSON value. Case classes that will
 *    be serialized/deser'd need to include their own validation to guard against unintentional nulls.

   * @note In general, [[fromJson]] should be preferred for String-to-Object conversion. This method is
   *       intended for secondary conversion after [[fromJson]] has been applied.
   *
   * @note This proxy method exists as an alternative to exposing the entire private `mapper` through a
   *       `getInstance` or `copy` method, so that the `mapper` remains a strict singleton and its
   *       configuration remains obscured. Otherwise, this is a direct proxy of the `mapper.convertValue`
   *       method from `ScalaObjectMapper` in Jackson, with added exception catching.
   *
   * @note Discovered via testing, this method does not play well with Optional data stored in `Any` fields.
   *       If you know that you need to serialize Optional values, please state them as Optional in
   *       their type declaration, e.g. in the example here with `Foo` and `Bar`. If a `None` is serialized
   *       in an object with an `Any` field, and you try to convert this as an `Option`, it will instead
   *       come out as a `null` value and you will have to post-process it as such. Instead, if the field
   *       is declared as a `Option[Any]` and a `None` is serialized, it will correctly be converted here
   *       as a `None`.
   *
   * @param obj the object to convert
   * @tparam T a context bound type
   * @return a [[scala.util.Try]] that is either the object of type `T`, or a
   *         `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException` in the case of a cast to an incompatible type.
